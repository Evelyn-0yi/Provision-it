  Fractionalized Real-World Assets Database Schema
</h1>

This project implements a proof-of-concept schema and system for **fractionalised ownership of real-world assets**.
It supports asset creation, fraction trading, valuation tracking, and historical ledger views.

## Problem Statement

We think creating a database schema for fractionalised ownership of real world assets will solve the problem of tracking, trading, and reporting asset fractions at scale.

**We'll know we've succeeded if:**
- Users can create assets, divide them into fractions, and trade them reliably
- The system maintains a clear ledger of ownership history and asset values (whole and fractional) at any point in time
- Queries remain performant even as the number of assets and trades grows large

## Project Scope

### Must Have
- Database schema for assets, fractions, holdings, users, and transactions
- Ability to trade fractions between owners with real-time updates
- Ownership ledger to view history and snapshots
- Asset valuation reporting (whole + fractional)
- Platform manager role for approving assets and setting fraction counts

### Nice to Have
- Support for multiple asset categories (property, collectibles, etc.)
- Query optimization and performance reports
- Performance/stress testing framework
- Basic UI with light/dark mode
- API layer with OpenAPI routes
- User authentication & activity tracking

### Not in Scope
- Real-time price feeds and external market integration
- Guest user roles
- Advanced trading features (bidding/auctions)
- Blockchain/tokenisation implementation

## Dependencies
Before cloning and attempting to run this code, you will need:
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Git (Optional, repo can also be downloaded as .zip)
- Virtual Environment (venv)

<br/>

## Getting Started

This project provides a complete database schema and API implementation for fractionalized real-world asset management, developed for Provision-it.

1. Clone this repo to your device.
2. Run the automated setup script:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `./setup_env.sh`
   - **Windows**: `setup_env.bat`
3. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure your `.env` file with database settings
4. Initialize the database schema and data: `python init_db_postgres.py`
5. Start the application: `python run.py` or `flask run`
6. Access the application at `http://localhost:5001`

<br/>

## Deployment

You can deploy this application to any hosting platform of your choice. For production deployment:

1. Configure production environment variables in `.env`
2. Set up PostgreSQL database on your hosting platform
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Initialize database: `python init_db_postgres.py`
5. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn: `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5001 run:app`

For detailed deployment instructions, see [SetUp.md](Document/SetUp.md).

## Database Schema

The core of this project is a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema designed specifically for fractionalized real-world asset management. The schema includes the following main entities:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles for asset owners and traders
- **Assets**: Real-world assets available for fractionalization (properties, collectibles, etc.)
- **Fractions**: Fractional ownership units representing portions of assets
- **Transactions**: Complete buy/sell transaction records with ownership transfers
- **Offers**: Trading offers and bids for asset fractions
- **AssetValueHistory**: Historical asset value tracking for both whole and fractional valuations
- **Portfolios**: User portfolio tracking and management

This schema enables reliable tracking of ownership history, real-time trading capabilities, and comprehensive reporting at scale.

For detailed schema information, see `schema_postgres.sql` and [ER_diagram.png](Document/ER_diagram.png).
