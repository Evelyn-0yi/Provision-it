## 5. RECOMMENDED TEST PRIORITIES

### HIGH PRIORITY (Core Business Logic)
1. **TradingService** - Critical for platform functionality
   - Trade execution logic
   - Fraction transfers
   - Transaction creation
   - Rollback scenarios

2. **OfferService** - Core trading feature
   - Offer creation/validation
   - Unit availability checks
   - Offer matching logic

3. **TransactionService** - Financial audit trail
   - Transaction recording
   - Historical queries
   - Integrity validation

4. **PortfolioService** - User-facing data
   - Portfolio calculation
   - Value aggregation
   - Transaction history

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Supporting Services)
5. **UserService** - Isolated unit tests
   - Separate from API tests
   - Business logic validation
   - Soft delete behavior

6. **AuthService** - Isolated unit tests
   - Session management
   - Password handling
   - Permission checks

---

### LOW PRIORITY (Infrastructure)
7. **Model Tests** - Relationship validation
8. **Database Constraints** - Trigger/function tests
9. **End-to-End Tests** - Complete user flows

---

## 6. TEST QUALITY OBSERVATIONS

### ✅ STRENGTHS
- **Comprehensive Auth API Testing:** Includes security tests (SQL injection, edge cases)
- **Good Service Layer Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns
- **Mock-Based Unit Tests:** Proper isolation from database
- **Fixture Management:** Well-structured test data setup
- **Database Isolation:** Separate test database with cleanup

### ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- **Inconsistent Coverage:** 30% service coverage vs 70% uncovered
- **Limited Integration Tests:** Mostly unit/API tests, few end-to-end flows
- **No Trading Logic Tests:** Critical feature completely untested
- **Missing Model Tests:** Relationship and constraint validation
- **No Controller Tests:** Direct controller testing absent
